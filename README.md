# Autonomous Raboteuse 

The need to intervene in environments harmful to humans, such as highly polluted environments, using methods of action without direct physical human intervention. 
Today's machines require the presence of an operator. The working time is therefore equal to the exposure time of the operator. The more time-consuming the task, the more the user of the machine is exposed to the ambulant pollution of the support to be treated. 

**Description of the Project**

The main goal is to have a robot that is completely autonomous with no external guidance, that generates its own path with its implemented algorithm with the highest precision rate possible. 

The project features are: 

- Data acquisition system 
A complete system allowing the rapid and simultaneous acquisition of point clouds thanks to cameras and sensors. 

- Data processing software 
A Software that is used to classify, pre-filter, and assemble data for georeferencing in three dimensions. The information thus collected will be used to produce a 3D model. 

- The integration of a microprocessor 
The use of a 3D model to define the most suitable route and the control of the machine. 

- The integration of a mobile application
The mobile application will display the progress of the robot to the user.
